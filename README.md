# Description

This project is aimed at using the [TripAdvisor Restaurants Info for 31 Euro-Cities](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/damienbeneschi/krakow-ta-restaurans-data-raw) dataset to find insights for a fictional European travel agency to help them grow their business.

A dashboard is created from the dataset to help travel agents make recommendations to their clients on the best food destinations while they are traveling in and around Europe.

# Getting Started

The dataset is available from `kaggle` website:  

[TripAdvisor Restaurants Info for 31 Euro-Cities](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/damienbeneschi/krakow-ta-restaurans-data-raw)  

You will also need the following:

•[Python 3.x](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
•[pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/getting_started/install.html)
•[Microsoft Power BI Desktop](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=58494)

# Installation

This step by step guide will get you up-and-running on your local machine.

1. Create and activate your virtual environment. I used [anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution) to create my virtual environment.  

    `conda create -n <yourenvname> python=<x.x> anaconda`
    `conda activate <yourenvname>`  
    
    **yourenvname** is your virtual environment name and **x.x** is your python version

2. Install pandas library

    `conda install pip`
    `pip install pandas`  

3. Open the notebooks in a code editor of your choice running on the virtual environment you just created.
